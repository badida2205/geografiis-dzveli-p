    is a large collection of over 17,000 to 18,000 islands[6][7] located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans in Southeast Asia and Oceania.[8] It is the world's largest archipelago,[9] with five main islands—Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Malaysia and Brunei), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).

Indonesia is famous for its biodiversity, unique animals and ecosystems that range from tropical rainforests to volcanoes, making it one of the most biodiverse countries in the world.[10][11] The cultural heritage of the Indonesian archipelago reflects a profound diversity, encompassing hundreds of distinct ethnic groups and languages. Its strategic location and natural resources have long made Indonesia an important trading center and a major player in regional and global affairs. Influenced by Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and European colonial cultures, Indonesia gained independence in 1945.


The Indonesian archipelagic baselines pursuant to article 47, paragraph 9, of the UNCLOS
The Indonesian archipelago consists of about 6,000 inhabited islands, with many others that are uninhabited.[3] These islands range from densely populated Java—often regarded as the economic and cultural heart of Indonesia, home to numerous candi (temples), including Borobudur, the world’s largest Buddhist temple—to small, remote islands. Bali is known as a tourist destination, famous for its nature and culture making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, Sumatra with its natural resources and strategic position on the Malacca Strait, and Komodo with its unique lizards. The Maluku Islands, or Rem-pah Islands, have an important history in the world spice trade.[12]
